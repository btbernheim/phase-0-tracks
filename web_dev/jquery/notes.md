1) Begin by browsing through any relevant material available on youtube for jqery tutorials
2) Locate an cheat sheats available
3) Look for any web pages that provide introductory information about jquery
4) Experiment with concepts

Spend some time trying to understand each new concept, and try it out in some physical code to ensure I understand it.
Take a 10 minute break at the hour mark.

I began with the youtube search, but found that I needed a little bit more background information to make sense of the introduced concepts. Once I had a good understanding of what jquery is, I began watching the videos again. The youtube videos were very instructive, and I could follow along with my own html document and experiment with syntax and new methods. I found that by searching for concepts on the web when a new concept was introduced in the video, I could gain an even more sound understanding of it. I didn't find the cheat sheats too helpful. I had the most success by nreaking down examples and trying them out on different elemnts and attributes. Pausing the video, experimenting with new concepts, and googling what confused me seemed to be the best approach for understanding the new material.
