1) The Philosophy of Linux-
Linux never assumes that the user is incompetent. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you do do anything you tell it to. Anything. Whether it is unintentionally bad or not. That is a huge amount of power in the hands of a user. Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power. That is egalitarian. Linux does not handhold. It assumes you know what you are doing when you type a command and it proceeds to execute that command without asking if you really want to. It gives you complete control.

9 Tenats of Linux:
Small is Beautiful
Each Program Does One Thing Well
Prototype as Soon as Possible
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Avoid Captive User Interfaces
Make Every Program a Filter

2) A VPS is a virtual machine that provides internet hosting. The virtual machines are created by a computer that sections off part of its memory and makes a copy of its own operating system within it. The VM acts as its own unity, seperate from the rest of the computer.

Advanatges of using a VPS:
-VPS hosting is a great way to have the services of a dedicated server but without the cost associated with it.
-Many VPS plans can be customized to meet your needs so you pay for what you want but you do not need to deal with any features you will never need.
-A VPS hosting account is less expensive than a full dedicated hosting plan that uses a physical server.
-Many VPS hosting plans are easily scalable. You can start off in your virtual environment with the minimum amount of resources you need and then as you grow gradually increase your hosting plan to accommodate your needs. You do not have to pay for excessive resources you have not yet grown into.
-You have a lot more control over your virtual server than you do with shared hosting. You will likely have root access and the ability to use scripts that may not be allowed in the shared hosting environment.
-Scalable and cost effective

Why you should't login as the root account in linux operating systems:

-Hackers are aware that every linux system has a root account, they will always be targeted.
-You can prevent unchangable erros by working off root.
-A security breach while on root will allow the hacker to have access to the entire system.
-Working off of root provides accountability, who did what.
