  <p>-Semantic tags act as containers that state their purpose to both the browser and developer. Their roles are meant to be clear and show what the contents of its container are about. Tags like nav, header, and ordered/unordered lists seem very usefull. Most web pages have use for and include them.</p>
  <p>-The order displays them from the top down.</p>
  <p>-I learned how to create a snippet with this challenege and it also helped to reinforce my idea of what differentiates semantic from non-semantic tags. I certainly think I will be creating/using snippets on further HTML work.</p>
  <p>-My pair and I struggled with creating the snippet. The rest of the challenege went fairly smooth, but we were struggling to figure out how the structure worked. After looking at the example and fiddling with it, we go it to work.</p>
